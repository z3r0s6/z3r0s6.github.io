I'm 16 years old and focused on becoming a Red Teamer.

I specialize in web and network penetration testing, with hands-on experience in:

- **Active Directory Exploitation**
- **Network Penetration Testing**
- **Web App Penetration Testing**

I use Python to automate reconnaissance and testing tasks, and I continuously improve my skills through labs, CTFs, and realistic attack simulations.

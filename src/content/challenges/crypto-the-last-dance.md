## Stream ciphers

At first, [Chacha20 looks quite intimidating][wiki-salsa20].

However, the cipher's complexity doesn't matter here:
In this scenario, Chacha20 does not directly encrypt the message but produces an independent byte stream.
And then this stream is used in a single XOR against the message.

```python
def xor(a, b):
    return bytes([__a ^ __b for __a, __b in zip(a, b)])
```

This is known as a stream cipher.

Anyway, since the key and the IV are the same for the encryption of the message and the flag, the cipher stream is the same.
XORing the encrypted message with the clear message will isolate the stream:

```python
xor(MESSAGE_CLEAR, MESSAGE_ENCRYPTED)
```

So that it can be canceled in the encryption of the flag:

```python
xor(xor(MESSAGE_CLEAR, MESSAGE_ENCRYPTED), FLAG_ENCRYPTED)
```
